# 3D Scene Animator
Group Project for Visual Computing @ UA


 The application should read from file and view distinct objects (at least 3) 
 and allow you to configure their position and orientation over time, 
 as well as the duration of each movement, 
 in order to generate an animation - for example, of a planetary system (simplified).
