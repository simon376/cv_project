# 3D Scene Animator
Group Project for Visual Computing @ Universidade de Aveiro

 The application allows the visualization of various 3D objects,
 which can be inserted in the desired place inside a SceneGraph.
 The models can be animated using translation, rotation and scaling.
 The application allows you to configure their position and orientation over time, 
 as well as the duration of each movement, 
 in order to generate an animation - for example, of a simplified planetary system.
